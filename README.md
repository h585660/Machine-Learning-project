ðŸ¤– Machine Learning School Project: "Because Machines Need Education Too!" ðŸŽ“
Hey there! Welcome to my (absolutely not created last night) school project where I tackled the age-old problem of... length of stays. I mean, who wants to overstay their welcome? Certainly not me. And certainly not the 30,000 test cases we had.

ðŸ¤” What's inside?
A couple of .csv files with mystery data. (Well, it's not THAT mysterious. One is for training, the other for testing. But let's keep the air of mystery going.)
A Python script that looks suspiciously like I actually did something!
My results, which prove that I didn't just watch Netflix while munching popcorn during the semester.
ðŸ“š How I Tackled the Project:
Loaded some data.
Preprocessed like a boss.
Trained using the mighty Random Forest Regressor because...trees, right?
Validated my model and saved it so it doesn't run away.
ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries:
pandas: For handling my data and ensuring I don't get bamboozled.
joblib: Because who wants to train a model every single time?!
sklearn: My partner-in-crime for everything ML.

ðŸ•º Fun Fact:
This project contains over 70,000 training cases. That's almost the population of a small city. They now know more about length of stays than most of us!
